Tests
=====

Each subdirectory stands for an ACE subset.

Subsets
-------

### ace

Full ACE.

Since there is no generator, we use the APE regression test set.
We take all the snippets that APE parsed correctly into a non-empty DRS.
Some normalization is performed, e.g.

  * sentence-initial function words are lowercased
  * punctuation marks are separated from the words

Results:

  * Parsed: 421
  * NOT parsed: 2351

Most failures are caused by missing content words in the GF ACE test lexicon
(which is easy to fix). The most frequent failures however feature some syntactic
structures and function words which the GF ACE implementation does not support.


### acewiki_aceowl

__AceWiki-supported fragment of ACE OWL__

AceWiki test set obtained by exhaustive generation with the Codeco grammar.
Content words: ask, Mary, woman, friend, mad-about.

  * Total: 19718
  * Runtime: ~39 sec

A few reasons (i.e. words and phrases) that cause the parse to fail:

  * mad-about (`mad about` does not seem to work either)
  * somebody X
  * somebody does
  * somebody who
  * Mary who
  * X who
  * is/are not
  * does/do not
  * which (as a question pronoun)


### acewiki_aceowl_modif

Same as `acewiki_aceowl` but some sentences are excluded.
These sentences feature constructs which are probably easy to fix.
Result: ~60% parsed.

### aceeditor

_Work in progress_

The ACE Editor subset is between AceWiki ACEOWL and full ACE.


Test files
----------

Each directory contains the following files.

### sentences.txt

Input sentences for the test.

### test_out.txt

Output of the test on the test sentences.
Each sentence is classified as __OK__ or __FAIL__.
In the latter case, the successfully parsed beginning of the sentence
is also provided.

### test_out_fail.txt

Frequency ranking of beginnings of sentences the parsing of which
failed (after the beginning).
This file helps to find the most common problem for the failure.
