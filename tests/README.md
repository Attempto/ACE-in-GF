Tests
=====

Each subdirectory stands for an ACE subset.

Subsets
-------

### ace

Full ACE.

Since there is no generator, we use the APE regression test set.
We take all the snippets that APE parsed correctly into a non-empty DRS.
Some normalization is performed, e.g.

  * sentence-initial function words are lowercased
  * punctuation marks are separated from the words

Results with the large Clex as the lexicon:

  * Parsed: 1212
  * NOT parsed: 1560
  * Runtime: ~10 minutes (large lexicon slows GF down)


### acewiki_aceowl

__AceWiki-supported fragment of ACE OWL__

AceWiki test set obtained by exhaustive generation with the Codeco grammar.
Content words: ask, Mary, woman, friend, mad-about.

  * Total: 19718
  * Runtime: ~39 sec

> bash make-pgf.bash grammars/acewiki_aceowl/ "words/acewiki_aceowl/TestAttemptoAce.gf"


### aceeditor

_Work in progress_

The ACE Editor subset is between AceWiki ACEOWL and full ACE.

### ontograph_40

Coverage test:

> bash make-pgf.bash grammars/acewiki_aceowl/ "words/ontograph_40/TestAttemptoAce.gf"

> bash run-test.bash tests/ontograph_40/sentences.txt

> cat test_out_fail.txt


Multilinguality test:

> bash make-pgf.bash grammars/acewiki_aceowl/ "words/ontograph_40/TestAttempto{Ace,Ger}.gf"

> cat tests/ontograph_40/sentences.txt | ./Translator ACE-0_0_2.pgf


Test files
----------

Each directory contains the following files.

### sentences.txt

Input sentences for the test.

### test_out.txt

Output of the test on the test sentences.
Each sentence is classified as __OK__ or __FAIL__.
In the latter case, the successfully parsed beginning of the sentence
is also provided.

### test_out_fail.txt

Frequency ranking of beginnings of sentences the parsing of which
failed (after the beginning).
This file helps to find the most common problem for the failure.
