c A star is a massive, luminous sphere of plasma held together by gravity. At the end of its lifetime, a star can also contain a proportion of degenerate matter. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun, which is the source of most of the energy on Earth. Other stars are visible from Earth during the night, when they are not obscured by atmospheric phenomena, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points because of their immense distance. Historically, the most prominent stars on the celestial sphere were grouped together into constellations and asterisms, and the brightest stars gained proper names. Extensive catalogues of stars have been assembled by astronomers, which provide standardized star designations.~n(Wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star )

c Infinitive clauses cannot be expressed (e.g., "A duty of a president is to...", "A president has an obligation to...").~n~nPassive constructions without an agent are not possible (e.g. "a president is relieved.(from duty)" is not possible, because the only allowed option is "relieved by").~n~nThe reasoner does not recognize the inconsistency between "Bulgaria is a country that is located in Europe" and "Bulgaria is in Africa". When I looked at the details of the two sentences, the fist one has the form "There is country X1. The country X1 is Bulgaria. The country X1 is located_in Europe." The second sentence has the form "Bulgaria is located_in Africa." The inconsistency is probably not detected because of the subordinate clause. In another pair of sentences, which do not employ subordination, the inconsistency is detected ("Georgi Parvanov is a president of a country and the country is Bulgaria." and "Georgi Parvanov is not a president of Bulgaria."). These have the paraphrases "A country X1 is Bulgaria. Georgi Parvanov is a president of the country X1." and "It is false that Georgi Parvanov is a president of Bulgaria."~n~n--Mariya K.
