ACE Resource Grammar
====================

This resource grammar inherits nearly everything from the English library, 
but serves as a place where ACE-specific modifications can be made cleanly.

The deviations from the English resource grammar are:

- `whom` has been replaced with `who`
- removal of comma `,` between an NP and its relative clause
- `nothing but`

Changelog
---------

- 2012-11-22: added OperAce and OperApe to provide a link to APE lexicon
- 2012-04-25: the relative pronouns `who`, `which` and `that` are allowed with any noun (phrase)
- 2012-04-23 (`a8e4745`): Re-implemented ACE RG as descendent of English rather
than an individual library.

TODO
----

  - maybe rename Oper{Ace|Ape} to Paradimgs{Ace|Ape}
  - in Oper{Ace|Ape}, rename acePN -> mkPN, etc.
