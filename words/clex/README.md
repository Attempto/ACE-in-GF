A Prolog script for converting APE's Clex lexicon into a suitable format for GF

If you already have a lexicon file downloaded, use build.sh
If not, use one of the download scripts:

- `download_large.sh` to download and build with the large Attempto Lexicon hosted at https://github.com/Attempto/Clex/blob/master/clex_lexicon.pl
- `download_small.sh` to download and build with the small Attempto Lexicon hosted at https://github.com/Attempto/APE/blob/master/prolog/lexicon/clex_lexicon.pl
