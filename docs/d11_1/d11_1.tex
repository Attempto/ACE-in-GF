\begin{abstract}
This report describes the implementation of a large part of the
Attempto Controlled English (ACE) syntax --- the so called AceWiki subset ---
in Grammatical Framework (GF) and making it available via [TODO: 10]
languages that are supported by the GF Resource Grammar Library (RGL).
The main goal of this work is to make ACE available to users who have little
English skills. Also, having a GF implementation of the ACE language would 
provide ACE users with new (GF-based) editing tools.

\section{Introduction}

\ace{} (ACE) \cite{fuchs:reasoningweb2008}
is a general purpose
first-order language (FOL)
with English syntax,
i.e. ACE can be viewed as both a natural language understandable to every
English speaker, as well as a formal language with a precisely defined
syntax and semantics understandable to automatic theorem proving software.
ACE texts are deterministically interpreted
via Discourse Representation Structures \cite{kamp:drt1993}.
The syntactically legal sentence structures and their
unambiguous interpretation is explained in the end-user documentation of
\emph{construction} and \emph{interpretation} rules.
The ACE toolchain includes a parser that maps ACE sentences into a concrete
DRS form \cite{ifi-2010.0010} and further into formats supported by existing
automatic reasoners (e.g. OWL, SWRL, TPTP).

End-users working with ACE can specify a lexicon that maps English
wordforms (nouns, verbs, adjectives, ...) into logical atoms, which the users
can interpret as they wish, but otherwise the ACE grammar or its mapping to
DRS cannot be changed.

Grammatical Framework (GF) \cite{ranta:book2011}
is a framework for defining multilingual grammars.

This paper is structured in the following way. In section ...

\section{Goals and requirements}

The main goals of this work is to make ACE available to users who have little
English skills by turning ACE-based systems like
AceWiki \cite{kuhn2010doctoralthesis} multilingual. This allows users
to create and consume content whose native format is a formal language like
OWL or TPTP in multiple natural languages
via an ACE-based interlingua (see figure \ref{fig:languages}).
Also, having a GF implementation of the ACE language would
provide ACE users with new (editing) tools that are based on the GF technology,
offering e.g. look-ahead editing, embeddable grammars, conversion into
speech recognition grammar formats, etc.

Note that this report describes the implementation of the ACE syntax,
i.e. not its DRS mapping.

Our main research questions are:

\begin{itemize}
\item what are the features and benefits of a general purpose multilingual
controlled natural language?
\item is it technically possible to implement the ACE syntax in GF,
and what are the benefits of such an implementation?
\end{itemize}

Requirements:

\begin{itemize}
\item make adding new languages as simple as possible
\item syntactic coverage and precision close to 100\%
\item multilingual translations preserve the precise
meaning assigned to the ACE sentences
\end{itemize}


\section{Existing work}

Our work builds on \cite{ranta:cnl2009_revised} which implements the syntax
of ACE v6.0 (by following \cite{ACE_6.0_Construction_Rules}) and makes it
available in 7 languages (English, French, German, Italian, Swedish, Finnish
and Urdu) via the GF Resource Grammar Library (RGL) \cite{ranta:lilt2009}.
Our goal is to update this implementation to ACE v6.6 and make it precisely
cover an important subset of ACE which we will refer to as the AceWiki subset.

The AceWiki subset is defined by a Codeco grammar \cite{kuhn:cnl2010_revised}
and targets a subset of ACE that is compatible with the OWL ontology language.
This makes the subset relevant in (Semantic Web) ontology editing applications.
The Codeco
grammar provides both parsing and generation and thus gives us an excellent
reference implementation against which we can test.

Our second goal is to extend the number of natural languages to which
the grammar is ported, and study the properties of the resulting multilingual
controlled natural language system.

Another work that already implements ACE in GF is
``ACE compliant controlled Latvian for ontology authoring and verbalization''
\footnote{\url{http://valoda.ailab.lv/cnl/}}
\cite{gruzitis:phd}. The goal of this work is to bidirectionally map Latvian
language sentences to OWL axioms and queries. The developed system
does not expose ACE to the end-user and only treats it as a
machine-readable format that provides access to the ACE tools
(bidirectional OWL converter). It therefore does not have to deal with the
generation of correct ACE wordforms.
The system is also not built with multilinguality in mind
(i.e. it does not use the general GF RGL APIs). It thus cannot serve easily as
a starting point of the work described in this document.


\section{Implementing ACE in GF}

We chose to focus on the subset of ACE 6.6
\cite{ACE_6.6_Construction_Rules} that is used by the AceWiki semantic wiki
system.
This subset is
quite expressive, roughly matching the expressivity of the OWL ontology
language
\cite{OWL_2_Web_Ontology_Language_Document_Overview}
without data properties.
The benefit of
targeting this subset is that it is formally described by a Codeco grammar
\cite{kuhn:cnl2010_revised}, which provides a good reference implementation.
With Codeco we can perform exhaustive generation of syntactically legal
sentences.

\subsection{Structure}

There are $\sim$50 functions.

We use GF RGL.

GF grammar module structure (see figure \ref{fig:modules}).

of one of the many concrete languages.}
\label{fig:modules}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Lexicon}

ACE makes a clear separation of lexicon and the rest of the syntax.
The 27 word form types can be added and redefined by the users
\cite{ACE_6.6_Lexicon_Specification}. The AceWiki subset uses a much smaller
but also a slightly different set of lexical categories.

\begin{itemize}
\item proper name (with possible abbreviation and \emph{the}-prefix)
\item common noun (with singular and plural form)
\item noun in an \emph{of}-construct (e.g. `part', `child')
\item transitive verb (with 3rd singular, bare infinitive and past participle
forms)
\item transitive adjective (e.g. `fond of')
\end{itemize}

We map these categories to GF categories as shown in
table \ref{mapping_acewiki_to_gf}.
[TODO: we have to ignore certain things, e.g.  the the-PNs?]

\section{Multilinguality}

\subsection{GF languages}

We selected the following languages which are supported by the GF RGL.
English, German, Finnish, Urdu, Italian, French, Swedish
(, Hindi, Spanish, Catalan?).

\subsection{ACE vs English}

Does it make sense to treat ACE and English as separate languages in the
grammar, and expose them as different languages to the end user?

\subsection{Main issues}

\section{Evaluation}

To test the coverage and performance of the GF implementation of the
AceWiki subset we have used
the AceWiki Codeco test set which
is an exhaustive set of sentences with length of up to 10 tokens
(19718 sentences in total).

To test the precision (i.e. possible over-generation) we have used GF's
random generation facility.

To test the correctness of the multilingual translations we have used
the sentences from the
Ontograph
Framework\footnote{\url{http://attempto.ifi.uzh.ch/site/docs/ontograph/}}
\cite{kuhn2009cnlmain}. These sentences cover all the main sentence
patters of the AceWiki subset and they have been used before in user
evaluations of how well the users understand the precise formal meaning
of the sentences.
These 40 sentences cover all the main AceWiki sentence patterns and have
a very clear set-theoretic meaning, e.g.
``Everything that is a traveler or that is an officer sees
at most 1 aquarium.'' means that the union of the sets \emph{traveler} and
\emph{officer} is a subset of the set of all instances that participate in
the 1st argument position in at most one \emph{sees}-relation with an
instance from the set \emph{aquarium}.
The question is if this meaning is understood in the same way via all the
languages.

\subsection{Syntactic coverage}


\subsection{Syntactic precision}

Over-generation is especially undesired in the context of look-ahead editing
\cite{schwitter:eamt-claw2003}, where users would be exposed to
forms which the actual language does not support.

Legal uses of definite NPs cannot be (easily) described in GF, e.g. GF
allows both ``every man likes the man'' and ``every man likes the woman'',
while AceWiki ACE OWL (as implemented in Codeco) allows only the
first one.

[TODO: other interesting cases?]

There are also
places where the AceWiki subset could be extended (rather that its GF
implementation restricted), e.g. AceWiki currently rejects ``every man
likes less than 3 men that own a cat.'' because an NP with a
generalized quantifier (less than 3) cannot be followed by a relative
clause. But this sentence is supported by the ACE-OWL translator
so there is no real reason why it should not be allowed in the
AceWiki subset.

Also, support for object relative clauses (``.. that Mary likes'')
is desirable (even though AceWiki does not support it).

\subsection{Multilinguality}

[TODO: interesting examples where the straight-forward translation produces
a completely different meaning]

\subsection{Performance}

[TODO: the GF parser is very fast]

\section{Availability}

The developed grammar is available on a GitHub
repository\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Attempto/ACE-in-GF}}.

\section{Future work}

In the
future, one might want to extend the implementation (using
the standard GF extension mechanism) to also cover full ACE.
