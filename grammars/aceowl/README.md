Subset of ACE that can be translated to OWL/SWRL.

_Work in progress_

It currently covers the same `acewiki_aceowl` sentences
that the full ACE implementation does, but overgenerates
much less. It might make sense to implement the full ACE
grammar as an extension of this grammar.

Only Attempto.gf has been changed compared to the full
ACE implementation.
