_Do not edit this directory!_

Because it is difficult to test the coverage and precision of this ACE fragment,
work on this grammar has stopped and this directory will be deleted.
Go to `acewiki_aceowl/` instead.

Subset of ACE that can be translated to OWL/SWRL.

It currently covers the same `acewiki_aceowl` sentences
that the full ACE implementation does, but overgenerates
much less. It might make sense to implement the full ACE
grammar as an extension of this grammar.
