Attempto Controlled English in Grammatical Framework
====================================================

Introduction
------------

This project implements the syntax of Attempto Controlled English (ACE)
(version 6.6) in Grammatical Framework (GF) and ports it to
additional natural languages (_Ger_, _Ita_, ...).
Note that this project does not implement
the mapping of ACE sentences to discourse representation structures.


Requirements
------------

### Coverage

The grammar should cover a reasonably large and interesting subset of ACE,
specifically the OWL-compatible subset that is supported by AceWiki.
Ideally, the grammar should cover the full ACE.

### Correctness

The grammar should not overgenerate, i.e. it should be possible to use the
grammar in a look-ahead editor (which explicitly exposes the coverage
of the grammar to the user).

### Multilinguality

The grammar should allow for bidirectional translations
between ACE and a number of other controlled natural languages
(_ACE-like_ German, Italian, Finnish, etc.).


Reference implementations
-------------------------

  * The reference ACE parser (APE) can be obtained from <https://github.com/Attempto/APE>. There is a web-based demo at <http://attempto.ifi.uzh.ch/ape/>.

  * The reference AceWiki grammar can be found at <https://github.com/AceWiki/AceWiki/tree/master/src/ch/uzh/ifi/attempto/acewiki/aceowl/>. There is a web-based demo at <http://attempto.ifi.uzh.ch/acewiki/>.


First commit
------------

This project started out as a port of an existing ACE-in-GF implementation.
The first commit was based on the 2011-12-14 version of
the GF darcs repository `examples/attempto/`-directory implemented
by the GF developers in 2009 targeting ACE v6.0. See also the publication:

	K. Angelov and A. Ranta.
	Implementing Controlled Languages in GF.
	N. Fuchs (ed.), CNL-2009 Controlled Natural Languages, LNCS/LNAI 5972, 2010.

This version does not completely match ACE v6.6,
i.e. some ACE constructs are not supported, e.g.
(__(F)__ marks things that the current version has already fixed)

  * __(F)__ transitive adjectives: `mad-about` (`mad about` does not seem to work either)
  * __(F)__ exactly
  * __(F)__ less than
  * __(F)__ everybody
  * __(F)__ everybody X
  * __(F)__ everything
  * __(F)__ somebody X
  * __(F)__ (some|every|no)body who
  * __(F)__ Mary who
  * `which` as a question pronoun
  * __(F)__ `is not` and `isn't` are not equivalent
    * __(F)__ `a woman is not a man .` fails
    * __(F)__ `a woman isn't a man .` succeeds
    * __(F)__ `a woman is not every man .` succeeds
    * __(F)__ `a woman isn't every man .` succeeds
  * __(F)__ `are not` and `aren't` are not equivalent
  * __(F)__ `does not` and `doesn't` are not equivalent
  * __(F)__ `do not` and `don't` are not equivalent
  * __(F)__ `who` (instead of `whom`) in object relative clauses (`a woman who a man sees`)
  * dative shift (`John gives Mary an apple`)
  * __(F)__ `does wait` (as alternative to `waits`)
  * adjective coordination
    - a rich and lucky man waits .
    - John is rich and lucky .
  * John is more rich. (`John is richer` works)
  * John always runs. (`John runs always` works)
  * VP coordination (of both positive and negative VPs) (Note that GF RGL common API supports Conj only with AP, Adv, NP, RS, and S; but there is support for VP coordination in ExtraEng.)
  * __(F)__ negated relative clauses (`that is not`, `that does not`, `that CN is not`)
  * __(F)__ negated WH-questions (`who does not like Mary?`)
  * __(F)__ WH-word in object position (`who does Mary not like ?`)
  * reflexive pronouns (e.g. `itself`)
  * strings and string concatenation
  * lists and sets

and it supports some constructs which in ACE do not exist, have been
deprecated or should be avoided (i.e. create a warning), e.g.

  * relative clause can be attached to any NP using a comma between the NP and the relative clause (in ACE: relative clauses can be used only for nouns, indefinite pronouns and proper names)
  * `he waits .` (and other unresolvable personal pronouns)
  * `the man waits .` (gives a warning in APE)
  * a man X is the man Y .
  * __(F)__ not more than, not at least, ...
  * numbers larger than 12 as words, e.g. `one hundred and thirty`
  * __(F)__ whom
  * __(F)__ such that
  * `- ( X + X ) waits .` (minus sign should be followed by a number)
  * `1 = - -1 .` (`-1` is a built-in GF integer)
  * __(F)__ `nothing except` (instead of `nothing but`)
  * __(F)__ multiple variables in apposition (`a man X X X Y ...`)
  * __(F)__ `there is/are` can take any NP as an argument
  * ...


Building
--------

_Note: based on GF darcs version: 2012-10-03 15:54:35 CEST_

The ACE-in-GF grammar can be turned into a PGF file in various ways
depending on

  - if the AceWiki-subset grammar or the full ACE grammar (experimental) is desired;
  - which vocabulary is included;
  - which languages are included.

Several targets are available in the Makefile, which start with the
`pgf_` prefix. To build the grammar execute e.g.

	make pgf_acewiki_aceowl # AceWiki grammar, ACE only, tiny test vocabulary
	make pgf_ontograph_40 # AceWiki grammar, all languages, small test vocabulary

To build the full ACE grammar (ACE-only) with a lexicon of ~1000 general words,
run

	bash make-pgf.bash

(Note that it is important that you use `bash`.)

The building should not take more than a minute.
The GF libraries are expected to be found in a system-wide location, e.g.:

  * ~/.cabal/share/gf-3.3/lib/present/
  * ~/.cabal/share/gf-3.3/lib/prelude/

and they should correspond to the GF version listed above (as the GF darcs push
timestamp).


Running
-------

Examples of translating an ACE sentence to other languages.

Using the PGF generated by `bash make-pgf.bash`:

	TestAttempto> p -lang=Ace "John gives an apple to a woman who John sees ." | l -treebank
	TestAttempto: baseText (sText (vpS (pnNP john_PN)
						(v3VP give_V3 (aNP apple_N)
							(aNP (relCN woman_N (slashRS which_RP (pnNP john_PN) see_V2))))))
	TestAttemptoAce: John gives an apple to a woman who John sees .
	TestAttemptoEng: John gives an apple to a woman whom John sees .
	TestAttemptoFre: John donne une pomme à une femme que John voit .
	TestAttemptoGer: John gibt einen Apfel einer Frau die John sieht .
	TestAttemptoIta: John da una mela ad una donna che John veda .
	TestAttemptoSwe: John ger ett äpple till en kvinna som John ser .

Using the PGF generated by `make pgf_ontograph_40`:

	TestAttempto> p -lang=Ace -cat=Text "it is false that Mary is helped by nothing but travelers who X admires ." | l
	it is false that Mary is helped by nothing but travelers who X admires .
	és fals que Mary és ajudat per nomÈs viatgers que X admira .
	't is onwaar dat Mary door slechts reizigers die X bewondert gehelpt wordt .
	it is false that Mary is helped by nothing but travelers who X admires .
	on epätotta että Mary autetaan vain matkustajien jotka X ihailee toimesta .
	il est faux que Mary est aidé par seulement des voyageurs que X admire .
	es ist falsch dass Mary durch nur Reisenden die X bewundert geholfen wird .
	è falso che Mary viene aiutato da soltanto viaggiatori che X ammira .
	es falso que Mary es ayudado por solamente viajeros que X admira .
	det är falskt att Mary blir assisterad av bara resenärar som X beundrar .
	GlT كہ Mary صرف مسافر جن X کی تعریفتا ہے سے متا ہے ہے


Testing
-------

### Parsing ACE sentences

The commands

	ghc --make -o Parser Parser.hs
	bash make-pgf.bash grammars/acewiki_aceowl/ "words/acewiki_aceowl/TestAttempto{Ace,}.gf"
	bash run-test.bash tests/acewiki_aceowl/sentences.txt

do the following:

  - compile a Haskell script that applies a PGF file to a text file,
  - compile a PGF file from a given GF source (grammar and vocabulary),
  - run a test on a given text file.

The test script creates two output files

  * `test_out.txt` all the sentences classified as OK or FAIL, with ambiguity shown in case of OK, and successfully parsed prefix in case of FAIL
  * `test_out_fail.txt`: frequency ranking of failed sentences

To run a test with the full ACE grammar and the 1000-word vocabulary on all the test cases in the tests-directory, execute:

	bash make-pgf.bash
	bash run-all-tests.bash > tests/run-all-tests.out 2> tests/run-all-tests.err

The output files are created into the subdirectories of the tests-directory.

Additional test-targets are provided by the Makefile.

### Translating from ACE to other languages

See the Makefile targets, that have the prefix `lin_`.

### Generating with ACE-in-GF and parsing with Codeco

See the Makefile targets, that have the prefix `test_precision`.

### Analyzing tree round-tripping

	echo "gr -number=10" | gf --run TestAttempto.pgf | ./Roundtripper -f TestAttempto.pgf -l TestAttemptoAce | grep DIFF



Changing
--------

Changes to the ACE grammar can be done in various places.

### lib/src/

ACE resource grammar. Based on the English resource grammar. Describes
deviations from the English grammar, e.g. ACE uses `who` instead of `whom`.

### grammars/

Implementation of different ACE subsets and their ports to other languages.
Contains the common interface AttemptoI.gf.

### words/

Different domain vocabularies. These files should rather be automatically
generated from existing terminology databases.
